# Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on an image dataset and utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately distinguish between the two categories.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Deployment:** Flask/FastAPI (Optional)

## Features
- Preprocesses images using **resizing, normalization, and data augmentation**
- Builds and trains a **CNN model** for classification
- Evaluates performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix**
- Supports real-time image classification via a web API

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-vs-dog-classification.git
   cd cat-vs-dog-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib flask
   ```
3. Download and prepare the dataset (Kaggle or other sources).
4. Train the model by running the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook cats_v_dogs_classification.ipynb
   ```
5. (Optional) Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the **Dogs vs. Cats** dataset, which consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is preprocessed for efficient training.

## Model Architecture
- **Conv2D layers** with ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling** for feature reduction
- **Fully connected layers** for classification
- **Softmax activation** for final output

## Results
The model achieves high classification accuracy with optimized hyperparameters. Performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**

## Deployment
The trained model can be deployed as an API for real-time classification. Flask or FastAPI is used to serve the model, allowing users to upload images and receive predictions.

## Usage
Run the Flask API and send an image for classification:
```sh
python app.py
```
Send a POST request with an image:
```sh
curl -X POST -F "file=@cat.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
```

## Future Improvements
- Implementing **Transfer Learning** using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet
- Enhancing dataset size for better generalization
- Deploying the model using cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud
